# Colour-recognizing-machine-learning-algorithm
A decision tree that recognizes RGB values that you input.

Sorry everything is in different classes. I was very into object-oriented programming at the time I made this :).

To use this algorithm, open it in Processing (I have only tested it with 3, so I don't know if it will work with Processing 2) and run it. If it gives some kind of cryptic error relating to loadStrings, check the training.txt file to make sure it looks like the one in the repository. I have found that sometimes, the formatting gets messed up when the project is downloaded. When it is running, it will prompt you to enter in an RGB value. Please use the format RRR, GGG, BBB or it won't work. The algorithm will tell you what it thinks the colour is. Then you can enter in a new colour value.
